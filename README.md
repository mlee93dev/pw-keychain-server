**App Purpose:**

This is the backend part of the PwKeychain app. The PwKeychain app is a personal project that serves to practice the creation of a backend, and the accompanying challenges that comes with trying to connect a frontend to a backend. It is a simple version of a password manager such as Safari's keychain.

It was coded using NodeJS, which was chosen due to the creator's familiarity with Javascript. 

**How to run the code**

Download your IDE of choice (Visual Studio Code, Atom, etc) and a copy of this repo. Next download and install NodeJS. Open the main folder such that your IDE directory points to 'pw-keychain-server/'. Run 'npm install' to install npm and then 'npm start' or 'node server.js' to run the code locally.
